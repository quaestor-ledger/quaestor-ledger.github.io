# Agent Rules

Rules for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository.

## Forbidden — destructive operations

Never run, script, or suggest any of the following here:

- `rm` / `rm -rf` on tracked or untracked files (stage removals with `git rm` on a reviewed branch instead)
- `git rebase` (interactive or otherwise)
- `git reset` (any mode — `--soft`, `--mixed`, `--hard`)
- `git push --force` / `--force-with-lease` / `--force-if-includes`
- `git filter-repo`, `git filter-branch`, BFG, or any history-rewriting tool
- `git clean`
- `git checkout -- <path>` / `git restore` that discards uncommitted work
- deleting branches or tags (local `-D` or remote)
- amending commits that have been pushed

## Required workflow

- History is append-only. Fix mistakes with a new commit or `git revert` — never by rewriting.
- Changes land on `main` via feature branches; keep commits small and reviewable.
- **This repository is the source of truth.** The copy vendored into
  `ORESoftware/k8s-cluster` (under `remote/deployments/`) is a *secondary* submodule
  checkout — after merging here, bump the submodule pointer there. Do not edit the
  vendored copy directly.

## Build context

Path dependencies (`../../libs`, `../../submodules`) resolve only when this repo is
checked out at its `remote/deployments/` path inside the `k8s-cluster` superproject.
Full builds happen there; standalone CI is limited to hygiene and format checks by design.

## Syncing with the remote

"Sync with the remote" (or just "sync") is a **two-way** exchange — pull the
remote's commits down **and** push yours up. It is never push-only, and a clean
local tree does not by itself mean "synced": you are done only once local and
the remote hold the same commits.

To sync:

1. **Commit your work first** (`git add` + `git commit`) so the tree is clean —
   pull/merge only into a clean tree. `git pull` / `git merge` aborts when an
   incoming change touches a file you have edited, and even when it doesn't it
   buries the merge in your uncommitted work. (Can't commit yet? `git stash`,
   then `git stash pop` after step 3.)
2. `git fetch --all --prune` — safe any time; it only updates tracking refs.
3. `git pull` (fetch + merge) — or `git merge` the upstream branch — to
   integrate the remote's commits.
4. `git push` to publish yours.

Integrate with **`git merge` / `git pull`**. **Never `git rebase` to sync** — it
rewrites history and breaks shared branches.

## Repository-local Git worktrees

- Create or use a Git worktree only when the human operator explicitly authorizes it for the current task. Concurrency or a dirty checkout is not permission by itself.
- Put every authorized worktree at `<repository-root>/tmp/worktrees/<name>`; from the repository root, use `./tmp/worktrees/<name>`. Never place worktrees beside repositories or organization directories.
- Keep `tmp`, `temp`, `tmp/worktrees`, and `temp/worktrees` ignored in the repository-root `.gitignore`. Do not commit files from those directories.
- Relocate or remove a worktree only when the operator explicitly requests it. Before removal, preserve and publish intended changes, verify its commit is represented on the target branch, and confirm there are no tracked, untracked, ignored-sensitive, or in-use files that must survive. Remove it with `git worktree remove <path>` without `--force`; never delete a worktree directory with `rm`.

## Canonical agent instructions

Before doing anything else in this repository, also read:

    .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

That path is a symlink to `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md`, whose canonical copy is
<https://github.com/ORESoftware/my-ai/blob/main/AGENTS.md>.

It exists at a fixed path *inside* the repository because some agents cannot walk up past
the repository root, so machine-wide instructions one or more directories above are
invisible to them. This pointer plus that path make the same file reachable from a working
directory anywhere in the tree.

The symlink is deliberately **not committed**: it names an absolute path that is only valid
on a machine with `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai` checked out, so committing it would produce a
broken link for everyone else and for CI. `.ores/` is git-ignored for that reason. If
`.ores/agents/AGENTS.md` is missing on your machine, create it with:

    mkdir -p .ores/agents
    ln -sfn "$HOME/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md" .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

or run `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/scripts/link-repo-agents.sh` once to do it for every git
repository under `~/codes`, and `--check` to verify them.

A missing `.ores/agents/AGENTS.md` is a setup gap on the reader's machine, never a reason to
skip the canonical instructions: fetch them from the URL above instead.
